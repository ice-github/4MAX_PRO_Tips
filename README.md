   - Retraction setting
```
I need to mention it, but direct drive extruder must not require retracts more then 1.5mm. If you can not achieve acceptable results with 1.5mm there is something really wrong with hot end part. Like it was with me, ptfe tube was 1mm shorter then needed and all was really bad
